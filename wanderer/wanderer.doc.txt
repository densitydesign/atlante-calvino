description :
a web-based tool for making 2 levels annotations on a literary text. Annotations are on two levels, meaning that for each annotation two ranges of text can be specified. Annotation structure is dynamical an can be edited via a tsv fields file
-----------------------------------------------------------
how to use :
-- to load a new text and analysis structure:
- in the main application block (left) click on the file selector button and select a literary text file (.txt format)
- in the sidebar (right), in the "Annotazioni" section click on "Browse..." and select a data structure file (.tsv format)
-- to make an annotation
Â° you must do this after having loaded a text, its data structure, and if necessary reloaded the work in progress
- highlight some text in the main block
- fill the various fields as required
- click "Subselection"
- highlight the second text range
- to save the annotation, click on "Salva l'annotazione". This WILL NOT save on disk : it will just add the annotation to the annotation collection
-- to export the annotations (i.e. to save all annotations to disk)
- click on "Esporta le annotazioni"
-> an annotations file will be downloaded
-- to load a text, its analysis structure and a work in progress :
- in the main application block (left) click on the file selector button and select a literary text file (.txt format)
- in the sidebar (right), in the "Annotazioni" section click on the file selector button and select a data structure file (.tsv format)
- in the sidebar (right), in the "Continua un'analisi lasciata in sospeso" section click on the file selector button and select an analysis file (.tsv format)

.working principles
the tool uses the selectionchange event to detect when highlighted text changes. The highglighted text coordinates (start and end character number) are stored in an object to track the annotation. A difficulty arises if previous, already saved annotations are present in the text, since each of them corresponds to a new tag. After each tag the coordinates are reset, so it becomes difficult to store the actual data. The solution adopted is saving actual annotation tags coordinates in a new custom attribute of the tag (its name is "data-pos"; see how it works in highlightAnnotationText() function); then the actual coordinates for the subsequent text are calculated based on these data.
