description :
a web-based tool to get nested json structures from an input csv with a denormalized hierarchy in its lines
how to use :
-- to load a new plot data file
- click on the file selector button and select an hierarchy data file (.csv format)
-> a json file will be automatically downloaded

.working principles
Hierarchies processed in this tool are to be intended as tree of hierarchical places, such as a city contaning a house containing a room. The input data put these multiple containing relations in single derivational lines : 

city -> house -> room

if the city also contains a park which also contains a wood, we'll have a second line such as :

city -> park -> wood

The object hierarchy obtained will be a single object city, containing a collection of child hierarchies : house and park; house will be contain in turn one more hierarchy (room) and so park (wood).

Merging of redundant branches of these hierarchies is obtained via single-key maps.

When the hierarchy objects have been created, they are subsequently iterated over, along with their children and so on, by a visiting algorithm which builds a corresponding json nested structure.

This tool was originally developed as a desktop program in C++. It had direct access on the computer file system. Now, due to the availability of the Emscripten compiler, a C++ compiler which produces javascript and wasm as target code (rather than assembly code), it has been possible to reuse it almost entirely (excluding just the C++ code related to file opening and writintg) by wrapping it into a very simple html page. The file loading and writing is deputed to the javascript code of the page.

.file list and possible file generation process
compile_library_emscripten.bat : this is a windows batch to compile the C++ library file in a javascript/wasm pair of files. To use on mac os / posix change the filename extension to .sh
index.html
input_data_spazio_gerarchie.csv
jellyfish-maker.doc.txt
library.cpp : this is the C++ source code
library_emscripten.js : this is the javascript file produced by the C++ library file compilation
library_emscripten.wasm : this is the wasm file produced by the C++ library file compilation
script.js : this the true page's javascript file. It will use also functions exposed by library_emscripten.js
style.css
